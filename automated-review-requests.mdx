## How Automated Requests Work

AskReview sends an email to the customer with your review link at the time you choose.  
You only need to set it once and the system handles the rest.

You can automate requests when:
- A customer completes a service  
- You finish a project  
- A customer makes a purchase  
- After follow up messages  
- At the end of a booking  

Emails are sent using Brevo for reliable delivery.
