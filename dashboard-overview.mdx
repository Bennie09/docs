## 📊 Welcome to Your Dashboard

The AskReview dashboard gives you a quick overview of your reviews, requests, and customer activity. Everything you need is available at a glance — no need for a separate analytics page.

## 📈 Review Analytics

Your dashboard shows two key charts that help you understand how your business is performing.

### **1. Review Growth (Line Chart)**  
Track how many reviews you’ve received over time.

### **2. Rating Distribution (Pie Chart)**  
See how many customers gave 5⭐, 4⭐, 3⭐, etc.

These analytics update automatically as new reviews come in.

## 🧭 Accessing Settings, Billing & Subscription

Settings are **not** located in the sidebar.  
You’ll find them in the **top-right corner**, inside your profile menu.

Here’s what the dropdown looks like:
