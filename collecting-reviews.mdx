## Embed a Review Button on Your Website

You can add a simple button or link that opens your review form.

Good places to add a review button:

## Best Practices for Getting More Reviews

<AccordionGroup>

  <Accordion icon="sparkles" title="Ask at the right time">
    Ask for a review right after the service is completed or the product is delivered.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="message" title="Keep your message short">
    Simple messages convert best.  
    For example:  
    "Thank you for your visit, could you leave a quick review for us"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="user" title="Personalize your request">
    Using the customer's name increases the chance they will respond.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="gift" title="Use incentives wisely">
    Small rewards like discounts or loyalty points can help, but should always be optional.
